This lab is available as part of my online portfolio at: <https://github.com/DemonPiranha/ITC-441-labs.git> 

Objective
---------

The purpose of this lab is to learn the basic principles of the Raspberry Pi platform by creating a webpage-controlled stoplight. These principles include:

-   Learn to enumerate requirements from use cases and user stories

-   Learn to utilize the general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins on the Raspberry Pi to control LEDs.

-   Learn to develop a minimum viable product and deliver new functionality through subsequent updates until the requirements are met, and all the deliverables are acceptable.

Materials
---------

I used the following materials to accomplish this lab:

-   Raspberry Pi 3b+

-   SD card with Raspbian OS

-   MicroUSB Cable with power source

-   HDMI Cable with monitor

-   USB keyboard and mouse

-   1 x breadboard

-   1 x Green LED

-   1 x Yellow LED

-   1 x Red LED

-   3 x 100 Ω Resistor (BrBlBrGl)

-   4 x Jumper Wires
